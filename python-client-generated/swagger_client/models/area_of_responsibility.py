    Client Master Data

    In the documentation below, you will receive detailed functional and technical specifications on the API DATEVconnect for Master Data.  **General information on dealing with fields administered as historical** A number of fields in the  master data are administered as \"historical\". This means that the existing content is not overwritten when the field is updated, but that the existing value remains in place, with a new value added that is valid from a date entered by the user.  Specifically, the following fields are administered as historical:  *Ressource 'addressees'* - short_names, - surnames, - company_names, - legal_form_ids  *Subordinate object 'detail'* - considerations, - denominations, - federal_states_of_natural_person, - job_titles, - marital_statuses, - codes_of_classification_of_economic_activities_2008, - descriptions_of_classification_of_economic_activities_2008, - mad_codes_of_classification_of_economic_activities_2008, - codes_of_classification_of_economic_activities_2003, - descriptions_of_classification_of_economic_activities_2003, - mad_codes_of_classification_of_economic_activities_2003, - countries_of_head_office, - distributions_of_profit, - enterprise_purposes, - federal_states_mad_of_legal_person, - federal_states_of_legal_person, - fiscal_years, - kind_of_register_courts, - locations_of_head_office, - names_of_register_court, - registered_company_names, - registration_numbers, - three_lined_company_names_first_line, - three_lined_company_names_second_line, - three_lined_company_names_third_line, - two_lined_company_names_first_line, - two_lined_company_names_second_line  These fields are shown as arrays, with their elements exhibiting the following structure: - value, - valid_from  This structure makes it possible to generate periods that indicate the validity date of a particular value in a value range.  This is illustrated by the following examples:  \"job_titles\": [   {\"value\":\"Müller\"},   {\"value\":\"Bäcker\", \"valid_from\":\"1995-04-01T00:00:00.000\"},   {\"value\":\"Metzger\", \"valid_from\":\"2001-07-01T00:00:00.000\"} ] In this example, the profession \"Müller\" (\"miller\") was valid until 03/31/1995. \"Bäcker\" (\"baker\") was valid from 04/01/1995 to 06/30/2001. The value \"Metzger\" (\"butcher\") is valid starting 07/01/2001.  For all the historically administered fields listed above, there is an additional field that indicates the current value of the value range (the value that is valid today/as of the system time). The syntactic structure of the property name is as follows: current_<*Property name of the historically administered field in the singular*>.  In the example above, the property name is \"current_job_title\" with the value \"Metzger\" (\"current_job_title\": \"Metzger\").  When writing fields administered as historical, please note that both properties have to be entered to prevent content from being lost. This can once again be illustrated using the example above:  Starting on 01/01/2010, the person is no longer employed as a butcher (\"Metzger\"), but now works as a landlord (\"Wirt\") in the hospitality industry. In order to save this information in the master data, the request has to be as follows:  ...  \"job_titles\": [   {\"value\":\"Müller\"},   {\"value\":\"Bäcker\", \"valid_from\":\"1995-04-01T00:00:00.000\"},   {\"value\":\"Metzger\", \"valid_from\":\"2001-07-01T00:00:00.000\"},   {\"value\": \"Wirt\", \"valid_from\": \"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000\"} ],  \"current_job_title\": \"Wirt\",  ...  If the property \"current_job_title\" had not been entered, but only the property \"job_titles\", then the current value (\"landlord\" in this example) would have been overwritten by a NULL value, as there would have been no explicit entry for the current value.  If, however, only the property \"current_job_title\" had been entered (i.e. without entering the property \"job_titles\"), then all historical values would have been overwritten. The result would have been the sole value of \"landlord\" without any time period set.  In summary, it can be said that the content of the property \"current_job_title\" overwrites the content of the valid array element of the property \"job_titles\".   # noqa: E501
